This is an improvement of the iGEM project of the 2008 Caltech team (Curing Lactose Intolerance) with greater emphasis on the design, construction and evaluation of various \u201clysis gene cassettes\u201d. \n", "matchesMostHelpful": [{"score": 0.3503, "name": "SJTU-BioX-Shanghai"}, {"score": 0.3367, "name": "IIT_Kharagpur"}, {"score": 0.3355, "name": "HFUT-China"}, {"score": 0.3094, "name": "HAFS-Korea"}, {"score": 0.3094, "name": "UMBC-Maryland"}, {"score": 0.2985, "name": "BGU_Israel"}, {"score": 0.2877, "name": "NYU-AD"}, {"score": 0.2631, "name": "Oxford"}, {"score": 0.2611, "name": "Amsterdam"}, {"score": 0.2544, "name": "USTC-Software"}], "keywords": [{"weight": 0.403, "text": "lactose intolerance"}, {"weight": 0.3287, "text": "consumption"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "beta galactosidase"}, {"weight": 0.3053, "text": "lactose"}, {"weight": 0.2384, "text": "design"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "galactosidase"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "intolerance"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "cassette"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "lysis"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "coli"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "gene"}, {"weight": 0.1282, "text": "evaluate"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "gene cassette"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "lysis gene cassette"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "lysis gene"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "lysis cassette"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "galactosidase enzyme"}, {"weight": 0.1142, "text": "beta galactosidase enzyme"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "beta"}, {"weight": 0.0306, "text": "digest"}, {"weight": 0.0205, "text": "US"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "cell lysis"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "Human Practices"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "Characterisation"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "strain"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "milk"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "release"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "OVERVIEW"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "Description"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "constitutively"}], "id": "1695", "matchesMostInNeed": [{"score": 0.5171, "name": "BGU_Israel"}, {"score": 0.4362, "name": "IIT_Kharagpur"}, {"score": 0.4321, "name": "Pitt"}, {"score": 0.4025, "name": "SJTU-BioX-Shanghai"}, {"score": 0.3963, "name": "Amsterdam"}, {"score": 0.396, "name": "USTC-Software"}, {"score": 0.3928, "name": "NYU-AD"}, {"score": 0.378, "name": "Vanderbilt"}, {"score": 0.3649, "name": "HAFS-Korea"}, {"score": 0.3641, "name": "UC_Davis"}]}, {"name": "Danzi_Kesh_8", "title": "Alergln Project", "abstract": "The Project's Goal:\r\nDevelop an innovative biological method for identifying gluten in food.\r\n\r\nThe focus is on developing a gluten binder protein.

In this way, the whole system can be induced by formaldehyde and express PADH and FDH to degrade it.\n", "matchesMostHelpful": [{"score": 0.282, "name": "Amoy"}, {"score": 0.2516, "name": "OUC-China"}, {"score": 0.22, "name": "HFUT-China"}, {"score": 0.1804, "name": "SPSingapore"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "CityU_HK"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "FAFU-CHINA"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "HAFS-Korea"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "SCUT-China"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "Shiyan_SY_China"}, {"score": 0.1779, "name": "SZU_China"}], "keywords": [{"weight": 0.3142, "text": "induced by formaldehyde"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "formaldehyde and express"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "express PADH"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "induced by formaldehyde and express"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "PADH and FDH"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "Vector pET"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "express PADH and FDH"}, {"weight": 0.3053, "text": "formaldehyde"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "dehydrogenase"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "T7"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "hxlR"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "PADH"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "FDH"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "polymerase"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "pET"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "gene"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "downstream"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "vectors"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "induced"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "degrade"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "express"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "special"}, {"weight": 0.0086, "text": "promoter"}], "id": "1706", "matchesMostInNeed": [{"score": 0.4594, "name": "Amoy"}, {"score": 0.4321, "name": "Pitt"}, {"score": 0.378, "name": "Vanderbilt"}, {"score": 0.3709, "name": "Berlin"}, {"score": 0.3462, "name": "FAFU-CHINA"}, {"score": 0.3403, "name": "Toronto"}, {"score": 0.333, "name": "British_Columbia"}, {"score": 0.3142, "name": "Lethbridge"}, {"score": 0.2969, "name": "Aix-Marseille"}, {"score": 0.2906, "name": "Minnesota"}]}, {"name": "KAIT_Japan", "title": "Control protein activity by light", "abstract": "Controlling protein activity by light is important for analyzing protein function and controlling synthetic biology system.However, previous methods require co factor or use toxic blue light.\r\nFluorescent proteins such as a Green Fluorescent Protein are widely used as optical sensor.

Second, in order to balance the increase of endogenous glutamate production, we optimized the expression level of pgsBCA genes (responsible for \u03b3-PGA synthesis) by replacing its native promoter with seven different promoters with various transcriptional activities.

In conclusion, the combination of a crowdsourcing platform and a novel design module makes complex design more accessible to synthetic biologists. \n", "matchesMostHelpful": [{"score": 0.4436, "name": "SKLBC-DGSYZX"}, {"score": 0.4404, "name": "USTC-Software"}, {"score": 0.3961, "name": "Glasgow"}, {"score": 0.3785, "name": "SKLBC-China"}, {"score": 0.352, "name": "Minnesota"}, {"score": 0.3305, "name": "UMaryland"}, {"score": 0.3217, "name": "London_Biohackspace"}, {"score": 0.3172, "name": "Hangzhou-H14Z"}, {"score": 0.3172, "name": "TU_Delft"}, {"score": 0.3172, "name": "Tec_Guadalajara"}], "keywords": [{"weight": 0.3142, "text": "synthetic biologists"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "design in synthetic"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "design in synthetic biology"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "ordinary differential equations"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "differential equations"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "ordinary differential"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "synthetic biology"}, {"weight": 0.3037, "text": "methods"}, {"weight": 0.2384, "text": "design"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "software"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "synthetic"}, {"weight": 0.1714, "text": "engineering"}, {"weight": 0.1205, "text": "using"}, {"weight": 0.1087, "text": "users"}, {"weight": 0.1087, "text": "complexity"}, {"weight": 0.1086, "text": "principle"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "module"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "biologists"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "platform"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "biology"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "differential"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "devices and systems"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "SYSU Software/Description"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "hard for synthetic biologists"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "basic units"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "users design"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "hard for synthetic"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "define the functions"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "module makes complex design"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "design module"}], "id": "1591", "matchesMostInNeed": [{"score": 0.7526, "name": "USTC-Software"}, {"score": 0.5293, "name": "TU_Delft"}, {"score": 0.5276, "name": "Glasgow"}, {"score": 0.5252, "name": "Tec_Guadalajara"}, {"score": 0.4921, "name": "Minnesota"}, {"score": 0.4878, "name": "UMaryland"}, {"score": 0.4829, "name": "SKLBC-China"}, {"score": 0.4792, "name": "BABS_UNSW_Australia"}, {"score": 0.4747, "name": "BGU_Israel"}, {"score": 0.4741, "name": "Sherbrooke"}]}, {"name": "SYSU_CHINA", "title": "Micro-Timer", "abstract": " This year, we develop a plug-in for microbes, a system that can build up a living clock for microbes and guide them to live regularly as well as to work efficiently.

We even make them into a fusion to test if the enhancement could be better. Thirdly, we use its amphipathicity to achieve protein separation, where they act as a special purification tag, and the system could be as simple as polymer, detergent and water.

The pseudo-egg delivery system takes advantage of a habit termites have of carrying their eggs to their nests and licking them. Termites recognize their eggs by sensing \u03b2-glucosidase and lysozyme, which act as egg-recognition pheromones. The pseudo eggs, containing both termite egg-recognition molecules and engineered E. coli, will be delivered to their nests and then licked by the termites present, thus allowing the  G3DH produced by the E. coli to convert trehalose into insecticide inside the termite bodies.

Through the expression of the Annexin V protein on their outer membrane, MicroBeacons bind to the apoptotic CTCs. Upon binding, MicroBeacons detect the increased lactate production of the CTCs via a lactate sensor and trigger quorum sensing between each other, which results in expression of fluorescent protein. Overall, the MicroBeacons selectively generate stronger fluorescence on the surface of sTRAIL-sensitive and lactate-secreting tumor cells compared to healthy cells.

By fusing LbCHI31 chitinase-encoding genes with a secretion signal peptide from alpha-amylase, we successfully generated an escherichia coli line that secretes chitinase specific to fusarium oxysporum, a major pathogenic fungi. LbCHI31 extracellular secretion and effectiveness were further quantified through characterization and analysis. This project will allow for easily accessible, cost-effective methods for producing effective chitinases that combat fungal infections, thereby increasing crop yield, stabilizing financial growth, and reducing famine globally.\n", "matchesMostHelpful": [{"score": 0.2668, "name": "Shiyan_SY_China"}, {"score": 0.2668, "name": "Missouri_Rolla"}, {"score": 0.2668, "name": "UCSF"}, {"score": 0.1911, "name": "TCU_Taiwan"}, {"score": 0.1411, "name": "Yale"}, {"score": 0.1369, "name": "Oxford"}, {"score": 0.0469, "name": "Westminster"}, {"score": 0.0424, "name": "British_Columbia"}, {"score": 0.0113, "name": "BGU_Israel"}, {"score": 0.0113, "name": "Danzi_Kesh_8"}], "keywords": [{"weight": 0.3142, "text": "methods for producing effective"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "fungal infections"}, {"weight": 0.3142, "text": "secretes chitinase"}, {"weight": 0.3053, "text": "fungi"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "LbCHI31"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "chitinase"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "fungal"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "secretion"}, {"weight": 0.1086, "text": "capable"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "mycotoxin"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "infections"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "crops"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "reducing"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "food"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "effective"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "developing"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "producing"}], "id": "1788", "matchesMostInNeed": [{"score": 0.4639, "name": "Missouri_Rolla"}, {"score": 0.2708, "name": "UCSF"}, {"score": 0.2164, "name": "Shiyan_SY_China"}, {"score": 0.211, "name": "Oxford"}, {"score": 0.2001, "name": "Yale"}, {"score": 0.117, "name": "TCU_Taiwan"}, {"score": 0.022, "name": "Bielefeld-CeBiTec"}, {"score": 0.0172, "name": "BGU_Israel"}, {"score": 0.0159, "name": "British_Columbia"}, {"score": 0.015, "name": "Westminster"}]}, {"name": "Tufts", "title": "Delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform into epithelial cells using Clostridium difficile toxin B", "abstract": "Our goal is to functionalize the CRISPR-Cas9 system as a therapeutic for the targeted disruption of deleterious genes in human cell cultures.

Of the 100 million U.S. hyperglycemic patients, twenty-six percent regulate spikes through self-administered insulin, which is costly or easily misdosed. To reduce the amplitude of PGSs, we designed a sugar-concentration-dependent microbial system that delays and reduces the absorption of glucose and fructose from the small intestine. To show proof of principle, we introduced two genetic devices into E.coli to polymerize glucose into glycogen, to polymerize fructose into levan, and to induce cell lysis to release the polymerized sugar into the gut, thus reducing the amplitude of the glycemic spike. This microbial system, as a one-dose-fits-all solution, dynamically adjusts to glycemic spikes of fluctuating amplitudes.

PCC 7002 (a fast-growing cyanobacterium capable of lipid biofuel production) and Sinorhizobium tropici CIAT (a nitrogen-fixing rhizobium which forms root nodules in legume plants). We then developed a workflow for the design, construction, and testing of MAGE and CRISPR technologies in non-model prokaryotes. The insights we gained from validating the propagation component of our workflow will serve to improve the versatility and robustness of our framework and will inform the development of tools for genetic manipulation in other non-model organisms.\n", "matchesMostHelpful": [{"score": 0.3782, "name": "Tec-Monterrey"}, {"score": 0.3563, "name": "Technion_HS_Israel"}, {"score": 0.3296, "name": "SYSU-Software"}, {"score": 0.2988, "name": "Aalto-Helsinki"}, {"score": 0.2988, "name": "UGA-Georgia"}, {"score": 0.2875, "name": "SKLBC-DGSYZX"}, {"score": 0.2339, "name": "Reading"}, {"score": 0.2333, "name": "BIT"}, {"score": 0.2333, "name": "BNU-CHINA"}, {"score": 0.2333, "name": "NUDT_CHINA"}], "keywords": [{"weight": 0.2142, "text": "Synechococcus sp"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "MAGE"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "Synechococcus"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "PCC"}, {"weight": 0.2054, "text": "genome"}, {"weight": 0.1267, "text": "engineering"}, {"weight": 0.1205, "text": "using"}, {"weight": 0.1087, "text": "capable"}, {"weight": 0.1086, "text": "model"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "sp"}, {"weight": 0.1054, "text": "genetic"}, {"weight": 0.0383, "text": "design"}, {"weight": 0.0153, "text": "selection"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "genome engineering"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "model organisms"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "cyanobacterium capable"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "Sinorhizobium meliloti"}, {"weight": 0.0142, "text": "genetic manipulation"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "Target"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "al"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "nitrogen"}, {"weight": 0.012, "text": "propagation"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "Bryant"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "cyanobacterium"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "prokaryotes"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "CRISPR"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "lipid"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "Metabolic"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "gene"}, {"weight": 0.0087, "text": "manipulation"}], "id": "1856", "matchesMostInNeed": [{"score": 0.4389, "name": "TecCEM_HS"}, {"score": 0.3843, "name": "Technion_HS_Israel"}, {"score": 0.3212, "name": "Tec-Monterrey"}, {"score": 0.3033, "name": "UGA-Georgia"}, {"score": 0.2825, "name": "Korea_U_Seoul"}, {"score": 0.2817, "name": "Vanderbilt"}, {"score": 0.2731, "name": "Amsterdam"}, {"score": 0.2708, "name": "NTNU_Trondheim"}, {"score": 0.2678, "name": "UC_Davis"}, {"score": 0.2628, "name": "Sherbrooke"}]}]
